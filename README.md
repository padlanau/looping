## Looping Statements and Functions : Looping Challenge

We'll do a little lab where you will do a stress test for a loop. This is not graded, but rather a way for your to practice ahead of our final challenge. Use this as a way to try loops out and share what you learn.
For this challenge, do a simple operation and run it in 1000 loops.
Alternatively, try to do a complex operation and run it in 100 loops.
Does the transaction throw an error? Why?

* loop1000() did not produce an error
* nestedloop() has produced an error "call to Looping.nestedloop errored: VM error: out of gas."
